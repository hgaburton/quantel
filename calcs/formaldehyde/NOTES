S0 : ground state 
1A2 : valence excitation n-> pi* 
1B2 : rydberg excitation n-> 3s 













The goal is run the calculation across all the LIIC geometries - so need to identity a number of physical solutions at equilibrium geometry first 

Structure of each calculations - what do we want from each 
- energies 
- Hessian indices of all states 
- energies of all states
- orbitals associated with each state

--- if we do for the equilibrium geometry - then can we just use GMF in order to follow the excited states. 
- are excitation energies measured relative to the ground state then - if thats RHF then is that just going to be shit? 




Thoughts 
 == CSF for the closed shell ground state is just the RHF determinant - as we go to more stretched geometries this will no longer be the case - i.e. something goes from an excited state to a ground state.
