Here is an example of reading in Daniel's fixed coefficients, running a controlled optimisation, and 
computing the subsequent many-body Hamiltonian/Overlap matrix elements.

Pre-requisites:
---------------
You will need to install PyBind11

'''
pip install pybind11
'''

You need to install the PyGNME package, which provides a Python wrapper for LibGNME:

'''
git clone https://github.com/hgaburton/pygnme
python -m pip install . -v --user
'''

Make sure that your python site-packages directory (where PyGNME is installed) is added 
to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Running the code:
-----------------
The recoupling code is in 
   ./recouple.py 
and should be run from the current directory as
   python3 recouple.py n2.xyz config.txt
This should reproduce the output in "output".

Interesting note on the result:
-------------------------------
We see some relaxation relative to Daniel's energy.

What is interesting is to look at the 3rd root with energy -106.879217 and coefficients
  0
  1
 -1

This state only has contributions from the Pi_x and Pi_y states with bond-order 2. I suspect
that these states are Delta_g symmetry, which transforms like x^2 - y^2...
